# Pimcore Social Media Library Bundle (SoML)

A Pimcore bundle for aggregating, normalizing and storing social media posts (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter/X, LinkedIn â€“ easily extensible).  
It downloads post metadata, optionally media files, persists them as Pimcore DataObjects and related Assets, and offers a pluggable provider architecture.
